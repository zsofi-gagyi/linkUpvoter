<h2>Link Upvoter</h2>
<h3>Deployed <a href="https://link-upvoter.herokuapp.com/">here</a></h3>
<br/>
<p>This is a simple forum featuring</p>

<ul>
<li>
threaded comments, displayed using recursion
</li>
<li>
Reddit-like upvoting and downvoting mechanics
</li>
<li>
paging, with an user-cosen minimum nr of posts/page
</li>
<li>
relative time ("posted x years, y months and z days ago")
</li>
</ul>

I also used this project to understand the concept of storing state client-side, without yet focusing on the details - that's how everything has ended up as a path variable.

On a technical level, this project uses 

<ul>
<li>
Java + Spring Boot + Gradle
</li>
<li>
Thymeleaf (with fragments)
</li>
<li>
Bootstrap (without it being the main focus)
</li>
<li>
Heroku for hosting
</li>
</ul>
